                <p> 
                ... you have .jpg images. You can convert (and resize) your images. <br>
                    In imageJ: click process > batch > convert and select output format 'JPEG' and set scale factor depending on your original image size. <br>
                ... your images are approximately 1000 px on 1000 px size. I worked with square-shaped images. <br>
                    If you have rectangular images, please contact me to make an update to the software. <br>

                <h5> How to train your own Deep Neural Network (DNN)? </h5>
                <p> Step 1: Choose sample name and select method "annotate". <br>
                Step 2: Choose region of interest: "full image". <br>
                Step 3: Fill in other settings such as resolution and image width. <br>
                Step 4: Click on select images for <b> mica </b> and select one transmitted light image. <br>
                Step 5: Annotate all tracks using left mouse button and proceed. You will receive a zip file with a txt file and jpg file. <br>
                Step 6: Repeat step 1 to 5 for ~50-100 images with different track densities. <br>
                Contact the developer (Simon) and let him train the DNN <b> or </b> follow the instructions below <br>
                Step 7: Make a zip-file with all txt, jpeg files. Add one file 'classes.txt' with content: "Track" <br>
                Step 8: Remove all "" in the txt files (2 per txt file). <br>
                Step 9: Upload the files to your Google Drive, open Jupyter notebook in <a href = "https://github.com/SimonNachtergaele/AI-Track-tive/blob/master/Train_YoloV3_.ipynb" style="color:#00336e;"> in Google Colab </a> and execute all. <br> 
                Step 10: Contact Simon (Simon.Nachtergaele@UGent.be) to upload the DNN to AI-Track-tive.
